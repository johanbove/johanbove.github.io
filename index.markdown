## Hi! My name is Johan.

I'm 35 years old and was born in Flanders, Belgium. I speak Dutch, English, German and some French. As a web professional I have gathered over fifteen years of professional experience developing websites.

People I worked with have called me an expert in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I know how to build complex, scalable browser applications starting from concept to design, which - I will try to make - work perfectly on any Internet-connected device. I take special consideration for accessibility and performance.

Every day I browse through ship-loads of articles and tutorials to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. I keep an eye out for cool open-source projects, scouting for the best coding examples of great software design and user experience.

In my professional career I worked on online job boards, e-commerce web shops, CMS systems (Drupal, WordPress), streaming media and smart-home automation platforms.

I am currently employed as an IT Consultant at CGI Deutschland where I am specializing in Front End Web Development.
