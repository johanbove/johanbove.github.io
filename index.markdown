# _An Info-Tech professional passionate about the World Wide Web._

<!-- So this is totally assuming I am still alive when you read this... *darkthoughts* -->

## Hi, my name is Johan!

### I work on websites

As a web professional I have gathered over fifteen years of hands-on experience developing websites.

People I worked with have called me an expert in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I know how to build complex, scalable browser applications starting from concept to design, which - I will try to make - work perfectly on any Internet-connected device. I take special consideration for accessibility and performance.

### I keep up-to-date

Every day I browse through ship-loads of articles and tutorials to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. I keep an eye out for cool open-source projects, scouting for the best coding examples of great software design and user experience.

### I'm an IT consultant

In my professional career I worked on online job boards, e-commerce web shops, CMS systems (Drupal, WordPress), streaming media and smart-home automation platforms.

I am currently employed as an Senior consultant at movento digital where I am specializing in Front End Web Development.

### To Germans, I'm an immigrant from Belgium 

My mother tongue is Dutch, and I speak English, German and some French.
I am {{ currentyear | minus:site.birthyear }}, grew up in a small town in the middle of Flanders, Belgium and I have been living in Germany since 2009. It's good to be European.
