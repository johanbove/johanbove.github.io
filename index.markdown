## About me

Hi! My name is Johan.

I'm Flemish-Belgian, speak Dutch, English, German and French and have over fifteen years of professional experience developing successful high-performance websites.

Colleagues and people I worked with have called me an expert in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's true that there aren’t many aspects of web site building and front-end development that I do not master. I have the know-how to build complex, scalable browser applications from concept to design, which - I will try to make - work perfectly on any Internet-connected device. With special consideration for accessibility and performance.

Every day I browse through ship-loads of articles and tutorials to keep up with the latest trends and technologies. I keep an eye out for cool open-source projects, scouting for the best coding examples of great software design and user experience.

In my professionaly career I worked on e-commerce web shops, CMS systems (Drupal, WordPress), streaming media and smart-home automation platforms.

I am currently employed as an IT Consultant at CGI Deutschland where I am specializing in Front End Web Development.
