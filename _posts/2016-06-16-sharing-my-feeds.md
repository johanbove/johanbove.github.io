I am an somewhat active user of both Feedly, Pocket and Twitter.

Since recently both great news reading tools offer the feature to share content. While I like to share interesting content I'm posting here both links to these services in the hopes it will serve you well.

I also keep the Twitter accounts I follow organized in lists.
