# Do you [Keybase.io](https://keybase.io)?

Keybase is a free, open-source security app and it's a public directory of people.

Mostly techies at the moment but Keybase promises cryptographically secure operations with people you know on the Internet: chatting, file sharing, even [publishing public documents](https://johanbove.keybase.pub).

Super safe and easy with Keybase!

Since 8th of February 2017 Keybase even includes [a secure chat](https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-chat).

Through the Keybase File System you can safely (**warning:** beta software might sting) store away privates or securily exchange files with your peers.

Keybase uses concepts from the [Web Of Trust](https://keybase.io/docs/server_security/following) where through verification of multiple accounts and the social graph an online identity can be trusted and contacted as the actual person you wanted to reach.

Pretty Good Privacy for the masses!

I invite you to [find me on Keybase right now](https://keybase.io/johanbove) and let's make the Internet safer!

All public announcements people on Keybase make are [verifiable signed by Keybase and hashed into the Bitcoin blockchain](https://keybase.io/docs/server_security/merkle_root_in_bitcoin_blockchain), whichs makes Keybase unforkable.

I perhaps don't fully understand all of the crypto-speak behind it, but it sure does sound super cool.
