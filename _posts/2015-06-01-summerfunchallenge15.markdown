We had a really great time organizing the event and are very happy you all came in good spirits, even-though the classic German summer weather tried to sabotage us by forcing a lot of you to come out through a true rain storm. Respect goes out to all of you and especially to the nine brave teams / participants of our Summer Fun Challenge!

Of the around 60 people attending the event, 47 votes were registered. Thanks to all who voted for their favorite project.

Without further ado, here are the winners for our Summer Fun Challenge 2015:
