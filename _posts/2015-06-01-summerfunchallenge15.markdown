Organizing the 2015 Google I/O Extended in Düsseldorf was a great experience!

As always the [Google's Developer Group community](https://developers.google.com/groups/) was super helpful to set up this event.

The [GDG Düsseldorf chapter](https://developers.google.com/groups/chapter/107373371386267684213/) team added a special contest which ended at the Google I/O called ["Summer Fun Challenge"](https://plus.google.com/107373371386267684213/posts/4Ha7AJL8SPM).

Many developers and tech enthusiasts from in and around Düsseldorf joined in good spirits, even-though the classic German summer weather tried to sabotage us with a true rain storm. My Respect goes out to all of the people attending and especially to the nine brave teams / participants of this year's Summer Fun Challenge!

The winners were chosen by the 60 guests attending the event. 47 votes were registered through a Google Docs form.

Things I learned during the organization of this event:
- Using Google Hangouts for video conferencing is really fun and feels like we're really in the future now.
- Google Docs forms have a "results summer" view.
- Scrolling in Google Sheets can be optimized. Had some trouble with this during the event.
- People can be super creative and funny at times.
- We have a great team in GDG Düsseldorf.
- Event registrations don't really mean that people will actually attend. We had an attendance rate of 54.13% of RSVP's.
