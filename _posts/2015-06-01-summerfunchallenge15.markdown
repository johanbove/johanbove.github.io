I helped out with organizing Google I/O Extended in Düsseldorf this year and I had a really great time organizing it. We added a special contest which ended at the Google I/O called ["Summer Fun Challenge"](https://plus.google.com/107373371386267684213/posts/4Ha7AJL8SPM).

I was very happy to see so many developers and tech enthusiasts from in and around Düsseldorf to to come in good spirits, even-though the classic German summer weather tried to sabotage us with a true rain storm. My Respect goes out to all of the people attending and especially to the nine brave teams / participants of this year's Summer Fun Challenge!

The winners were chosen by the 60 guests attending the event. 47 votes were registered through a Google Docs form.
