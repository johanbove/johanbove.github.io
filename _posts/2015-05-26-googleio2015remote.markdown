## Google I/O 2015 remote

Together with the GDG Düsseldorf gang I have been helping to organize the [Google I/O 2015 remote event in Düsseldorf](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/ce0gksqbf0ck94511sv5sv5hb0g).

Our event registrations are closed by the way! It is wonderful how many people registered but unfortunately the available space is limited and we want to keep it comfortable for all attendees.

I will be at the Simvelop offices in Düsseldorf this Thursday for sure.

See you there!

## The Event Stream

I figured I would also include the Event feed widget here, mostly to just check out what is going on in San Francisco.
