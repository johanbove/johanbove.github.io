title:  "Learning iOS development"

So I just installed [CodeBlocks](http://www.cprogramming.com/code_blocks/) on my work dev machine (DELL XPS-12 running Windows 8.1) so I can run C code.

Why? Well, I am currently [learning](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-objective-c--mobile-13944) all about [Objective-C and iOS development](http://code.tutsplus.com/series/learn-ios-sdk-development-from-scratch--mobile-14536).

The excellent tutorials are written by fellow Belgian [Bart Jacocs](http://tutsplus.com/authors/bart-jacobs).

You might think it is strange since you need an Apple computer to do anything related with iOS. Well, the company I am currently working for needs an iOS app in preparation to the HomeKit craze which is expected to happen as soon as devices come available on the market. Developers need to work with Apple's Xcode for iOS development, so they ordered a Mac Mini exactly for this purpose for me. I the meantime nothing stops me from learning about the new programming language, tools and everything around this using my Windows PC while waiting until the shiny new Apple gear arrives.

There is a whole bunch of new concepts I have to get used to, since my background as a front-end web developer working in JavaScript, Java etc is very different from the Apple World of Programming. But I am certain I will be able to get going quickly because of the plethora of documentation online.

The concepts I need to master in short-term, in no particular order:

* Objective-C
* Using an Apple machine
* XCode IDE
* iOS guidelines

So wish me luck! I'm going in.
