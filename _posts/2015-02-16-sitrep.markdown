> What have I been up to in the last couple of months? Listing up the sites and tools I have been using mostly in the last months.

## Working on single-page web applications

The project is built using [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) AMD modules and on top of the [KnockoutJS JavaScript framework](http://knockoutjs.com/), so the whole app is developed using the Model View ViewModel pattern.

We apply [Visual Studio Online](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/what-is-visual-studio-online-vs.aspx)'s planning tools and it's cloud code repository. *Visual Studio Online was previously know as Microsoft Team Foundation Service.*

The JavaScript application is unit-tested using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) (Behaviour Driven Unit Testing) and the tests are run during builds using the [Chutzpah](https://github.com/mmanela/chutzpah) Visual Studio extension. We apply [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) to compile the CSS code on top of [PhantomJs](http://phantomjs.org/), a headless browser running the Webkit engine.

Most images are created in SVG. We target only Internet Explorer 9 and upwards so we don't have to worry about older browsers or have to load in many shims and polyfills.

The project is going strong for a year and we keep adding improvements and features.

## GDG and Webworkers meetups in Düsseldorf

The [Google Developers Group](https://developers.google.com/groups/) is a great bunch of mostly German "computer geeks" who like to hang out and talk about programming, web technologies and gadgets.

The [GDG Düsseldorf](http://www.gdg-dus.de) meetup happens at least once a month with a couple of bigger events during the year at Google I/O and the yearly full day DevFest.

I only recently started attending the WebWorkers Düsseldorf Meetup group. The topic was "DevOps" so pretty relevant to my job. It was a well-attended event and the presentation and questions were interesting.

## Got a Surface Pro 3

Deciced not to get a Chromebook because of lack of performance in the portables, but go all in with Microsoft's [Surface Pro 3](http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/products/surface-pro-3) ultrabook/tablet device. Yep, it's pricey but I believe cost is justified.

I got it complete with the TypeCover and the Dock since I'm using it mostly as the replacement to my old Dell laptop. But with the goal that I would be able to bring the machine along with me on my daily commutes, for it being so portable.

So far, I'm a satisfied owner. It really is the all-purpose device one needs these days since it combines the best of the tablet and ultrabook features. I would call it an ultra-tablet. You can say that [I love my Surface](http://www.lovemysurface.net/).

In fact I've installed [Visual Studio Community 2013](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx) and am planning to use this tool as my main IDE, since using the Ultimate Edition in my daily job is pretty neat and I do like the way Microsoft is moving. Of course I am going to use the community edition only for open source and studying.

## Reading a lot of articles

So I have been collecting a lot of articles to "read later" in my [Pocket](http://getpocket.com) account and [Feedly](http://feedly.com) feeds. Thanks to [IFTTT](http://ifttt.com) I add a couple of must-read feeds from other blogs.
