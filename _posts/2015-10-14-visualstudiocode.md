## Visual Studio Code is like Visual Studio Light

Well-known web developer, [Dave Rupert](http://daverupert.com/2015/10/windows-editors-and-shells/) introduced me to this new Multi-Platform (Windows, Mac AND Ubuntu :sparkles:) editor made by Microsoft.
You can download your own "preview" "for free" over at <https://code.visualstudio.com> while supplies last.

## First Impressions: "5 minutes in"

- Solid Markdown support. This editor is made for creating notes in Markdown, including previews!
- Cool fresh interface.
- Great, familiar way of navigating around folders and open files if you're used to Visual Studio.
- Integrated Git support! :rocket:

## More to follow ...

This post will be updated with more experiences and impressions as I go along.

## Some initial questions

- Can I use this editor for free developer commercial applications?
- Will it stay free?
- What's the status of plugins adding missing features and functionality?
- Does it support GitHub's Two-Factor authentication?
