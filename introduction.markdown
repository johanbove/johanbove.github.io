## Perpetually online exploring the zest of the Web in all its interactive facets, virtual and tangible.

[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rifleman%27s_Creed) This is my introduction, there are many others like it, but this one is mine.

I don't always share the coolest online content, but when I do, I do it - mostly - through [Google+](https://plus.google.com/+JohanBové)

I'm fairly active in the [GDG Düsseldorf developers community](https://plus.google.com/communities/113782579160655007812), where I help organize events and presentations.

This site was deliberately kept simple to achieve a super [high PageSpeed / Mobile Friendly site score](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.johanbove.info).

I'm not a very graphical guy, as you might have guessed. Nonetheless I do like [cool pictures](http://1drv.ms/1Oxc4iF).

## My bragging rights

- Married a beautiful American/Italian girl.

- Rides his bicycle to work whenever he can.
- Flosses at least six times a week.
- Is capable of applying a thesaurus to seem smarter in online profile introductions.
