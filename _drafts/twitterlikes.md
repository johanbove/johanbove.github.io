Since when is Twitter all about the feelz? I used the "star" system to also bookmark and mark tweets as important. That did not always mean I actually "loved" the tweet.

Why did you not look at Facebook and how they had pushed themselves in a corner with the "like" button?

Really disappointing move from you guys.

I said it before and I want to say it again: if Twitter becomes Facebook, I'm gone.
