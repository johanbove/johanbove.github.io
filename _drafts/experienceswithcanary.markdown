# Outline

- What is Canary.is? What is the device?
- Who are the people behind it?
- Refer to the Indiegogo campaign. How did it all get started?
- Received the Canary.is device as announced in the mail end of February 2015. Mention how the international shipment took longer.
- Unpacking was brilliant. Beautiful packaging. Premium feel to the device itself. Stickers!
- Some initial setup issues: firmware update during first install, volume of my phone (Moto X 2014) was down.
- Hardware seems to be working fine. Fish-lens camera and the infrared work great. Also recorded video quality seems good. The sensors seem to be working normally too. Temperature, humidity, air-quality, etc.
- App was okay for installing the device but has some big problems:
  - Can't invite extra house members (Erica)
  - Playing the recorded video clips is terrible. Some issues:
    - time stamp does not show seconds.
    - the playhead does not move along the playing of the video clip.
    - the video takes a long time to start playing.
  - The sirene should have an extra trigger to avoid accidental activation.
  - The air quality control should display measured values, not just graphical display of comparative air-quality.
  - The app should come with "guest" modus, so people who don't need to be able to administer the app, can also install it. It is possible that the application actually already supports this. Haven't gotten to it to install the app on Erica's phone yet.
  - The geo-fencing works great on my Moto-X, probably since I have location reporting turned up full.
- Support from the Canary Team is great. Fast Twitter response and the e-mail support seems to have caught up  with the support requests.
- I've set up a Google+ Community for Canary users called CUCO: Canary User COmmunity. As of writing there aren't any other members yet, except for Canary's Google+ account which I personally invited. Haven't done any promotion for the group yet. Idea is to post articles to links and sites and create polls. *Wondering how I will find and invite more users?* :question:
- Finding a good position to place the device proved troublesome. First placed it in the hallway but this felt too much like an invasion of our privacy. Currently the Canary found a place behind the TV where it's monitoring our hard-drives and TV computer. Not really what the device was originally was thought to surveil, but it feels safe to keep it there until the software is more mature and bugs and potential security issues are resolved.
