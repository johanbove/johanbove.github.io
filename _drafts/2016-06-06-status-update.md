# Weeks are flying by!

Another month just flew by. Time for an update on what I have been up to since my last post...

## Visiting MA, USA

Family visit across the Big Pond! We loved Boston with a boat trip north over the Massachusetts Bay to the quaint town of Salem.
Staying in Cambridge was interesting, with a fun sunday out to the inspiring MIT Museum.

## Learning EmberJS

Yep, I'm doing Ember!

### Motivation

Using the best Single Page Application framework.
