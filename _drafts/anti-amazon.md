Got really upset by the fact that Jef Bezos is the richest man in the universe by owning a company which does not pay taxes, nor does he do himself. Therefore I made it my challenge to step away from Amazon and find alternatives.

- Amazon is not paying any taxes.
- Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the universe.
- Stop using Amazon
- Find alternatives to Amazon
- Transfer Amazon book collection to PDF
- Move music on Amazon music to local PC?

Just I like took back "control" over how much Google has influence on me, I want to achieve the same thing with Amazon.

## Amazon alternatives to Kindle books?

Books "bought" on Amazon are actually not your property. You "buy" the permission to read these books on the device of choice by Amazon. You cannot convert the AWS files from Amazon books to PDF.
