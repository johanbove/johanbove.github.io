# How to create new file templates in Visual Studio Community

So I would like to add the New Item template for Visual Studio for my Jekyll blog. The goal is to have a quick way to create a new blog post using a wizard like interface. The wizard should ask what file name the file needs to have, what layout should be used, what title the post should have, which date is should be published and finally in what categories the post should be kept it.

Currently going through the articles on MSDN, but it seems like the "Creating Project Types", could be a bit of overkill for this purpose.
